                    <div property="dcterms:abstract" datatype=""><p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p></div>

The retrieval act is partly based on new dataset announcements in World Bank mailing lists. Although the data retrieval and transformation phases are conducted by independent scripts, the commitment to retrieve and store the data is based the readiness of the meaningful and usefulness of the data transformation to an RDF serialization. Hence, Java and Bash scripts are executed manually to retrieve in order to:</p>

                            <p>In order to arrive at a proper and useful Linked Data representation, some of the following problems were solved either with a script or manually updated, and others were brought up to the World Bank team's attention for investigation.</p>

                            <h5 id="data-review_world-bank_missing-units">Missing units</h5>
                            <p>The statistics of the World Development Indicators consists of various indicators in different measurement units. At the time of this writing, these measurements in the source data are only provided as part of the string of the indicator name, as opposed to an explicit XML node [].</p>

                            <p>Some of the observations in the World Development Indicators dataset do not have measured data. The nodes for the values were given in the API response, however they contained no numerical values []. Hence, in order to keep the RDF-ized version of the dataset lean, these observations were excluded in the data transformation phase.</p>

                            <p>While the World Bank API provides endpoints which compiled aggregate data for the <em>WDI</em>, some of these calls were left out in the retrieval process.</p>


                            <h6 id="data-review_world-bank_most-recent-values">Most recent values</h6>
                            <p>Most recent values were incorrectly introduced to non-date API calls [] in <em>WDI</em>. These observation nodes were excluded in the transformation phase since the data already contained observations with corresponding reference periods.</p>

                            <h5 id="data-review_world-bank_naming-patterns">Naming patterns</h5>
                            <p>Different naming patterns were identified across World Bank datasets. Some of these are as follows:</p>

                            <h6 id="data-review_world-bank_region-names">Region names</h6>
                            <p>Region names as used in <em>WDI</em> and <em>WBF</em> datasets differed [] in a way that although they essentially conveyed the same meaning, labels did not match exactly. In order to have URIs for the region labels in the <em>WBF</em>  observations, and to simplify the linking process, unique region names from the <em>WBF</em>  observations was added to region resources in <em>WDI</em>. During the XSLT process, the alternative labels were matched with the labels in the observations themselves to arrive at their canonical representations.</p>

                            <h6 id="data-review_world-bank_credit-loan">Credit and Loan names</h6>
                            <p>Based on a private discussion with the WFI team, it was determined that the vocabulary terms <em>Credit Status</em> and <em>Loan Status</em>, as well as <em>Credit Number</em> and <em>Loan Number</em> was used interchangeably. Thus, the canonical representation for the Linked Data URI pattern was to use one: <em>Loan Status</em> and <em>Loan Number</em>.</p>

                            <h5 id="data-review_world-bank_missing-countries">Missing countries</h5>
                            <p>Some country codes were identified in the <em>WDI</em> observations that were not defined in the <em>WDI</em> country code list. These were later added to the original data [] [].</p>


                            <p>XSLT 2.0 transformations was then applied on the original XML files to arrive at an RDF/XML serialization. Saxon's command-line XSLT and XQuery Processor tool was used for the transformations, and employed as part of Bash scripts to iterate through all the files in the datasets.</p>

                            <p>In order to import this data into the RDF store rather efficiently, <a href="http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html">rapper</a> RDF parser utility program was used to first re-serialize each RDF/XML file as N-Triples and appended to a single file at run-time before importing.</p>

                            <h4 id="data-modeling_world-bank"></h4>
                            <p>The data is primarily composed of observations (e.g., development indicators, financial loans, climate for a countries) using the RDF Data Cube vocabulary. There are also code lists for classifications like countries, currencies, projects, loan numbers, global circulation models and so on.</p>

                            <h4 id="vocabularies">Vocabularies</h4>
                            <h5 id="vocabularies_world-bank">World Bank</h5>
                            <p>Besides RDF, RDFS, XSD, OWL, the most common vocabularies in these datasets are: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube</a> for modeling statistical observations, <a href="http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx">SDMX</a> for statistical codes, British reference periods (<a href="http://reference.data.gov.uk/doc/year">Year</a>, <a href="http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/gregorian-interval/">Gregorian Interval</a>), <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core">SKOS</a>, <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">DC Terms</a>. Where appropriate, properties and classifications were created to represent World Bank Linked Data. The <em><a href="#uri-patterns">URI patterns</a></em> section gives a further break down of this.</p>

                            <p>Properties that happen to be semantically the same, yet, syntactically different in the source data was collapsed into a single namespace in order to have a canonical name across the datasets, as well as to minimize the number of vocabulary terms.</p>

                            <p>In the case of country codes, it should be noted that ISO 3166-2 is used as the primary representation for countries. For example, the URI <code><a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CA">http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CA</a></code> identifies the country Canada in the datasets. It contains a <code>skos:exactMatch</code> to <code><a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CAN">http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CAN</a></code> and vice-versa with 2 or 3-letter <code>skos:notation</code>s.</p>

                            <p>Data was only altered by removing white-space at the start and end of text content. Some of the dates in the data were transformed into equivalent representations in IS0 8601 format.</p>

    -->
                            <p>The dataset is interlinked (~380 links) with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a> for countries and currencies, and (~216 links) with <a href="http://eurostat.linked-statistics.org/">Eurostat</a> for countries using <a href="http://aksw.org/Projects/limes">LInk discovery framework for MEtric Spaces</a> (LIMES). With respect to some of the concepts for code lists, they were manually matched with corresponding <code>skos:exactMatch</code> or <code>skos:closeMatch</code> links to DBpedia.</p>

                            <p>Additional interlinking was done by adding links to resources with corresponding homepages on the World Bank site, as well as links to referenced documents.</p>

                            <p>Futher interlinking was done by adding links to resources with corresponding homepages on the World Bank site.</p>

                            <p>A code list for currencies was created based on <a href="http://www.currency-iso.org/dl_iso_table_a1.xml">currency and funds code list</a> to represent the SDMX attributes for the amount measurements in the World Bank Finances datasets. They were also linked to each country which officially uses that currency.</p>

                            <p>Given that some of the codes in the World Bank country code list are not considered to be countries e.g., <code>1W</code> representing <em>World</em>, only the resources that represent a real country have an added <code>rdf:type</code> instance of <code>dbo:Country</code>.</p>

                        <p>The application for the the WBLD is viewed in the form of chart visualizations. A custom API is built to pull the necessary data out of the application. The parameters for the API are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>indicator</code>, which accepts a single indicator code (<code>skos:notation</code> of the indicator URI)</li>
                            <li><code>country</code>, which accepts multiple country codes (<code>skos:notation</code> of the country URI)</li>

                        <p>The <code>indicator</code> parameter is a required as one of the dimensions in the observation needs to be known. The other required dimension is either <code>country</code> or <code>year</code>.</p>

                        <p>Two API calls are made due to modular design approach; the first call is made to get the metadata about the indicator, whereas the second call is made to collect either all of the observations for the countries with that indicator, or all of the observations for a given reference period with that indicator.
